#+title: org-link-style

* Introduction

[[style:foreground=red][This]] is a package introduces an org-link type =style=, in order to
render the description of the links with a given face.
It then also renders the same colors into =latex=, =html= and =markdown=
through the org-exporting mechanisms.

Let us say you want to have something in an html or latex document that resembles

[[file:images/Introduction/this-is-a-red-text.png]]

then you would write

#+begin_src org
[[style:foreground=purple4&background=#e066ff][This is a red text]]
#+end_src

This would get exported to latex for instance like

#+begin_src latex
\colorbox[HTML]{e066ff}{\textcolor[HTML]{551a8b}{This is a red text}}
#+end_src

and you would also see this face within org-mode.


* Syntax

** TODO Attribute syntax
** Face name syntax

You can provide an already defined face name to the link
by prepending an =@= sign to the face name.
For instance you could use the =alert-high-face=
in a text like so

#+begin_src org
[[style:@alert-high-face][This is a text with an alert face]]
#+end_src

which in this case would get exported to html as

#+begin_src html
<span style='color: #972500;'>This is a text with an alert face</span>
#+end_src
