#+title: org-link-style

* Introduction

[[style:foreground=red][This]] is a package introduces an org-link type =style=, in order to
render the description of the links with a given face.
It then also renders the same colors into =latex=, =html= and =markdown=
through the org-exporting mechanisms.

Let us say you want to have something in an html or latex document that resembles

[[file:images/Introduction/this-is-a-red-text.png]]

then you would write

#+begin_src org
[[style:foreground=purple4&background=#e066ff][This is a red text]]
#+end_src

and you would also see this face within org-mode.
